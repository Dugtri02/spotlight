# Spotlight Bot Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-02-10

This Privacy Policy explains what data the Spotlight bot collects, why it is collected, and how it is used.

## 1. Data We Collect
The bot stores only data required to operate its features, including:
- Guild IDs and configuration settings (roles, rotation intervals, limits, and related options)
- Role IDs used for spotlight selection, blacklists, booster perks, and fallback roles
- Rotated user IDs used to avoid repeat selections
- Basic operational metadata (timestamps for last rotation and related scheduling)

The bot does not store message content, DMs, or user-generated content beyond role/member identifiers needed for operation.

## 2. How We Use Data
Data is used only to provide and maintain the bot's functionality, including role rotation, configuration, and safeguards.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not sell or share stored data with third parties. Data is only accessed by the bot and authorized maintainers for support and maintenance.

## 4. Data Retention
Data is retained only as long as necessary for the bot to operate. Guild owners may request a data purge.

## 5. Data Removal Requests
Guild owners may request a purge of their account or guild's data by contacting support in the official [support server](https://discord.gg/Dt8jxXsXwe) and proving ownership of the guild.

## 6. Removal and Purge
We reserve the right to remove the bot from any guild and to purge data when necessary, with or without notice.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy at any time. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 8. Contact
For support or data requests, contact the bot [support server](https://discord.gg/Dt8jxXsXwe).
